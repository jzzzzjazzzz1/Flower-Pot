## 🐛 Pull the Latest Bug Fixes into VS Code

> **Already have the project cloned?** Follow these steps to get the latest bug-fixed code into your local folder.

Open the `Flower-Pot` folder in VS Code and press **Ctrl + `** to open the integrated terminal, then run:

### Option A — One-command update (recommended)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\update.ps1
```

**Mac / Linux / Git Bash:**
```bash
bash update.sh
```

The script will automatically switch to the latest bug-fix branch, pull all changes, install any new packages, rebuild assets, and run new migrations.

### Option B — Manual commands (copy-paste one by one)

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax
git pull origin copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
npm install
npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
```

Then start the server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** ✅

### What was fixed in this branch

| Bug | File | What changed |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Dashboard page showed blank content | `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` | Converted from `<x-app-layout>` component syntax to `@extends('layouts.app')` + `@section('content')` to match the layout |
| Profile page showed blank content | `resources/views/profile/edit.blade.php` | Same fix — layout syntax now consistent with every other page |

---

## 🆘 Fresh Start — Nothing Is Working? Do This.

> **No MySQL needed.** The app now uses SQLite by default — just run the commands below and everything works automatically.

### Step 1 — Clone (or re-clone) the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Unique-Khanal/Flower-Pot.git
cd Flower-Pot
git checkout copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax
```

> ⚠️ The `git checkout` line is **required** — the setup scripts only exist on this branch.

### Step 2 — Run the one-click setup

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

**Mac / Linux / Git Bash:**
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The script will automatically install everything and seed the database. **No manual configuration needed.**

### Step 3 — Start the server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** ✅  All photos should now be visible.

---

### 🚨 PowerShell says "cannot be loaded" or "not recognized"?

Run this **once**, then re-run `.\setup.ps1`:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Or bypass for this one run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1
```

---

### 🆘 If the setup script still fails — run these commands one by one

```powershell
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
npm install
npm run build
copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductSeeder --force
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** ✅

---

## ⚡ Quick Start — Run ONE command in VS Code terminal

Open your `Flower-Pot` folder in VS Code, open the terminal (**Ctrl + `**).

**First — make sure you are on the correct branch** (do this once after cloning):
```powershell
git checkout copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax
```

Then run the setup script:

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

> If you get a *"cannot be loaded"* error, run first:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> ```

### Mac / Linux / Git Bash
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

That's it — **no database configuration needed.** The script will automatically:
1. Switch to the correct branch (`copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax`)
2. Pull all the latest code
3. Install all PHP & Node packages
4. Build the frontend assets
5. Create your `.env` file (SQLite, zero config)
6. Run all database migrations
7. Seed all product data (prices, images, categories)

After setup is done, start the server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** ✅

---

## 🔄 Pull the Latest Code

Use this every time new changes are pushed to the project.

### Option A — One command (recommended)

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\update.ps1
```

#### Mac / Linux / Git Bash
```bash
bash update.sh
```

The script pulls the code, installs any new packages, rebuilds assets, and runs new migrations automatically.

---

### Option B — Manual git commands (copy-paste these one by one)

```bash
git pull origin copilot/fix-layout-component-syntax
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
npm install
npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
```

Then start the server (run this separately):
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** ✅

> 💡 After pulling, always run `php artisan serve` to start the server if it is not already running.

## ✏️ Editing the blade files

After running `setup.ps1` (or `setup.sh`) your `resources/views/` folder will contain:

```
resources/views/
├── layouts/app.blade.php            ← navbar, cart drawer, footer
